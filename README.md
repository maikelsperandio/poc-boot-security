# Spring Security Implementation

This project is a POC of an implementation of the Spring Security framework. At this time is implemented with Form Based and Database authentication, I'm not using any specific database, but there's an interface called ApplicationUserRepository that can be implemented to retrive users from any database, actually I'm using a  _fake_  implementation.
